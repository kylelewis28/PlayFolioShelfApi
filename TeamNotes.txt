//Get MVP working, then revisit models
    //Models don't necessarily need all properties its entity counterpart does (i.e., don't need Id's in models/create models--but will want for a GET model.)
        //In future, break models down within their own subdirectories: functionally speaking, in a real app, we'd want basically a 1:1 of models to respective methods
            //EX: a "GameCreateModel" to go with the "CreateNewGame()" method in the services. (Use smart naming! Model=ModelType + Action + Model, Method= Action + EntityType)

            EX:   
                PlayFolioShelf.Models
